In the context of this assignment, I undertook the development of a task management application using the Python programming language. I opted to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application, leveraging the Tkinter library, while also being granted full autonomy in selecting the interface type, which could have been either console-based or GUI-based.
  
The primary functionalities implemented encompassed the ability

1)To view the existing to-do list

2)Create new tasks

3)update existing ones.

To facilitate data storage, manipulation, and retrieval, I chose to integrate the SQLite3 database within the application architecture. This database served as a robust repository for the efficient management of tasks, including their creation, updates, and retrieval.
