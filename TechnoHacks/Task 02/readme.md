#  Temperature converter

This code is a simple Python program for temperature conversion between Fahrenheit (F) and Celsius (C) scales. It defines a function called converter(scale) that takes a temperature scale as an argument (either 'cl' for Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion or 'fe' for Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion) and performs the conversion based on the user's input.
